# Regex-Engine
This repository shows how to build a Regex-Engine from Scratch

Several Steps are needed to convert a Regex into executable code.

1. Create an AST from the Regex to define the structure.
2. Use Thompson construction to build the NFA that decribes the Regex.
3. Create a DFA from the NFA with subset construction. 
4. Use Hopcroft's or Brzozowskiâ€™s algorithm to simplify the DFA.
5. Convert the DFA to executable code.

In this repository all these steps are implemented and a learning project to see how all these algorithms work together to create executable code from a regex.
